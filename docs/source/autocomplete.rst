.. _AUTOCOMPLETE:

Autocomplete
============

To have autocomplete during development of task scripts in you IDE you can add task-library bindings.


- Copy the ``task-library`` repository to your machine

  There are two ways to copy task library files to your computer:
        - via cloning
            - clone the repository https://github.com/genestack/task-library
            - ``git checkout stable``
        - download
            - download https://codeload.github.com/genestack/task-library/zip/stable
            - unpack


- Add the ``genestack`` folder to your python path in IDE, so you can inspect sources and use autocomplete in your IDE.
